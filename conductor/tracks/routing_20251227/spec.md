# Track Spec: Implement Distinct URL Routing and Navigation

## Overview
This track focuses on ensuring that all resource-related pages and secondary content have unique, predictable, and addressable URLs. This supports the "Simple URL Access" vision, allowing students to bookmark and share specific resources directly.

## Goals
- Define a clear URL hierarchy for resources (Regulation -> Branch -> Year/Semester).
- Ensure the landing page remains clean and distinct from internal resource pages.
- Implement dynamic routing for resource categories and individual subjects.
- Verify that deep linking works correctly across all routes.

## Success Criteria
- Students can navigate to a specific semester's resources (e.g., `/R18/CSE/3-1`) directly via URL.
- Sharing a URL leads exactly to the intended resource or category.
- The browser back/forward buttons work as expected across all routes.
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained across all new or modified views.
