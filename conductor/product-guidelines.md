# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Minimalist Foundation:** The UI should prioritize utility and speed, using high contrast and clean typography to ensure content is the focus.
*   **Modern Accents:** Incorporate vibrant accent colors and rounded corners to provide a fresh, contemporary feel that resonates with a student audience.
*   **Information Hierarchy:** Use clear spacing and font weights to guide users through the Regulation -> Branch -> Semester hierarchy without overwhelming them.

## Tone of Voice
*   **Encouraging & Student-Friendly:** Use warm, supportive language (e.g., "Good luck with your studies!", "Found what you need?").
*   **Helpful & Accessible:** Instructions should be clear and jargon-free, making the platform feel like a helpful study companion.

## User Experience (UX)
*   **Frictionless Navigation:** Every design choice must support the goal of "minimum clicks to content." 
*   **Smooth & Informative Transitions:** Utilize subtle Framer Motion animations for page transitions and element entries to provide a polished, high-quality feel.
*   **Clear Feedback:** Provide distinct loading indicators and success/error states to keep users informed during data fetching or link resolution.
