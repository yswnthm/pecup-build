To provide university students with a frictionless, high-speed platform for accessing academic resources. The goal is to eliminate navigation clutter and ensure students can reach their study materials—notes, papers, and syllabus copies—with the absolute minimum number of clicks.

## Target Audience
*   **Primary:** University students seeking immediate access to academic materials.

## Core Value Proposition
*   **Simple URL Access:** A navigation structure designed for predictability and speed, allowing easy sharing and bookmarking of deep links.
*   **Zero Friction:** Bypassing unnecessary detail pages or complex login walls for public resources.

## Key Features
